        "The second Test between England and India, held at Edgbaston in Birmingham from July 2 to July 6, 2025, concluded with a resounding 336-run victory for India, leveling the series 1-1 and marking their first-ever Test win at that venue.\n",
        " This match was defined by standout performances from Shubman Gill and Akash Deep, who played pivotal roles in India’s dominance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Batting Highlights\n",
        "Shubman Gill, captaining India in this Test, delivered a record-breaking performance with the bat. He scored 269 in India's first innings and followed it up with 161 in the second innings, amassing 430 runs in the match. His leadership and batting prowess earned him the Player of the Match award.\n",
        " Other notable contributions came from Ravindra Jadeja, who scored 89 in the first innings, and Yashasvi Jaiswal, who added 87.\n",
        "\n",
        "England’s batting was led by Jamie Smith, who scored 184 in their first innings, and Harry Brook, who contributed 158. In their second innings, Smith again stood out with 88, but no other batter could provide substantial support.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bowling Highlights\n",
        "India’s bowling attack was relentless, with Mohammed Siraj taking 6 for 70 in England’s first innings. However, the standout performer was Akash Deep, who took 4 for 88 in the first innings and followed it up with a maiden five-wicket haul of 6 for 99 in the second innings, finishing with a match haul of 10 wickets. This made him only the second Indian bowler after Chetan Sharma in 1986 to achieve such figures in English conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Match Flow\n",
        "India batted first and posted a massive total of 587, with Gill and Jadeja forming the backbone of the innings. England responded with 407, thanks to Smith and Brook’s efforts, but were always behind in the contest. India declared their second innings at 427 for 6, setting England a daunting target of 608. England never came close to that target, collapsing to 271 in their second innings, with Akash Deep once again at the forefront of the Indian bowling attack.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Moments\n",
        "Akash Deep’s Spell: On the final day, Akash Deep’s 6 for 99 sealed the match for India, with his ability to exploit the conditions and the cracks on the pitch proving decisive.\n",
        "Gill’s Leadership: Shubman Gill not only led from the front with the bat but also took the final catch to seal the victory, fittingly off Akash Deep’s bowling.\n",
        "England’s Struggles: Despite Jamie Smith’s valiant 88 in the second innings, England never looked in control, with their batting line-up crumbling under pressure.\n",
        "This victory was a historic moment for India, not only for the emphatic margin of the win but also for the emergence of new heroes like Akash Deep and the leadership of Shubman Gill. England, on the other hand, will need to regroup quickly as they head into the next Test at Lord’s, where they will aim to bounce back in the series.\n",

This historic win marks India's first-ever Test victory at this iconic venue, leveling the series at 1-1 and sending shockwaves through the cricketing world.

Shubman Gill, leading the charge, smashed a breathtaking 269, a testament to his exceptional talent and composure.  Ravindra Jadeja provided valuable support with a well-crafted 89, while Yashasvi Jaiswal contributed a solid 87.  This substantial first innings lead set the tone for the match.  In their second innings, Gill continued his magnificent form, scoring another century (161), contributing to a declaration at 427/6, setting England a challenging target of 608 runs.\n",

Jamie Smith displayed remarkable resilience, scoring 184 in the first innings and 88 in the second, showcasing his class and determination. Harry Brook also contributed significantly with a first-innings score of 158. However, the lack of consistent support from the rest of the batting lineup proved to be their undoing.  Despite Smith's heroic efforts, England's batting order crumbled under pressure, failing to build substantial partnerships.\n",

This exceptional feat, only the second time an Indian bowler has achieved this in England (after Chetan Sharma in 1986), cemented his place in cricketing history.  His ability to exploit the conditions and extract crucial wickets proved decisive, particularly his devastating 6-wicket haul in the second innings on the final day, which effectively sealed the match for India.  Mohammed Siraj also contributed significantly, taking 6 wickets for 70 runs in England's first innings.\n",
